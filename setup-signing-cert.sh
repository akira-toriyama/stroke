# Create a persistent self-signed code-signing identity in the LOGIN
# keychain so that the Accessibility (TCC) grant for Wand.app
# survives rebuilds.
#
# Run ONCE. macOS may prompt to unlock your login keychain — that is
# the only interactive step. Afterwards `package.sh` auto-uses the
# identity (it writes the name to `.signing-id`).
#
# Why this works: TCC keys an app's grant to its code-signing
# identity. Ad-hoc (`codesign -s -`) has no stable identity, so
# every rebuild looks "new" and the grant is lost. A reused
# self-signed cert keeps the identity constant — exactly the trick
# facet uses to keep its Accessibility grant alive across rebuilds.
#
# Homebrew note: the install-time `brew` subprocess may not be able
# to reach the login keychain (sandbox + non-interactive). The
# Homebrew formula tries this script first and falls back to ad-hoc
# with a LOUD warning if it can't. Users who want persistent grants
# across `brew upgrade wand` should run this script + `brew
# reinstall wand` once.
